<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em;">See what I did there?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6em;">This was a pretty obvious multiple choice question, and you had infinite tries to get it right. The goal of the example in the previous section wasn't to assess you, or to challenge you. It was simply to make you figure out the information for yourself -- either from your own experience (constructive learning), or at least manipulate and interact with the information if you got the answer wrong the first time (active learning).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">While there's no guarantee that you actually understood how you got to your answer (it's not a very good assessment tool) there is a fair chance that you now currently know the answer itself (it's a reasonable information delivery tool).</span></p>
<p>When I originally built out the MITx platform, I didn't include multiple choice questions. They're usually pretty poor choices for assessments. What I didn't realize at the time is that they're often a wonderful choice for information delivery. There is substantial evidence that as we move up the spectrum for passive to active to constructive, students learn more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
