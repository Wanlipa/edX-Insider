<h2>Please do not skim</h2>

<p> This course is a form of <i>experiential learning</i>. It will take about an hour to complete. To learn from this course, you should not only pay attention to the <i>content</i> of this course module but also to the <i>instructional design</i>. We intentionally include both good ways to do things and bad ways to do things. As you go through the course content, it's essential you actually watch the videos and do the exercises (including taking 10 minutes for the Pythogrean Theorem sequence), and more importantly, think about what worked and what didn't. </p>

<p> People who skimmed this course <i>universally</i> found the process to be a waste of time and missed most of the point. People who went through and finished the course generally found the process rewarding. If you do not have an hour to complete the course, please come back another time. </p>

<p> Remember: Learning is an <i>active</i> process. </p>
