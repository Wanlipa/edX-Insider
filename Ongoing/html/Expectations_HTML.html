<h2>Experiential Learning -- do not skim</h2>

<p> This course is a form of <i>experiential learning</i>. It will take about an hour to complete. To learn from this course, you should not only pay attention to the <i>content</i> of this course module but also to the <i>instructional design</i>. We intentionally include both good ways to do things and bad ways to do things. As you go through the course content, it's essential you watch the videos and do the exercises (including taking 10 minutes for the Pythogrean Theorem sequence), and more importantly, think about what worked and what didn't. </p>

<p> As you do, try to think about this course, and draft some of your thoughts. Generating this feedback will help you think about pedagogy and apply what you're learning. If you're comfortable with it, <a href="mailto:pmitros@edx.org">send me your thoughts</a>, or post them in the discussion forums. If you're not, keep it to yourself. If you'd like to contribute more substantially, please make a <a href="https://github.com/pmitros/edX-Insider">pull request against the course on github</a>. </p>

<p> People who skimmed this course <i>universally</i> found the process to be a waste of time and missed most of the point. People who went through and finished the course generally found the process rewarding. Please block off a full hour for the course. If you do not have an hour to complete the course, we'd encourag you to come back another time. </p>

<p> Remember: Learning is an <i>active</i> process. </p>
