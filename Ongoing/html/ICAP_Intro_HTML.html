<p>There's a neat framework for thinking about how students learn called ICAP.&nbsp;The gist of ICAP is that there are four ways of delivering information:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive</strong>: For example, listening to a lecture. Watching a video. Quietly reading a book.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Manipulating concepts. For example, underlining text in a book, or working through a problem applying information just learned.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Constructive</strong>: Figuring things out. Creating new information. For example, deriving a key theorem, or writing a paper.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>: Learning through peer interactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms used here mean very different things to different people.&nbsp;In particular,<span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;<strong>constructive learning</strong> has very different meanings in different research communities. Many members&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">in educational philosophy use it interchangeably with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)" target="[object Object]">constructivist learning</a>, which is at best weakly related to the</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;definition from&nbsp;ICAP (which comes from a cognitive science community).&nbsp;</span>Just to have a common language, throughout this course, we'll use the language of&nbsp;ICAP (and use constructivist when refering to the use from&nbsp;educational psychology).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><span style="line-height: 1.6;">I originally&nbsp;designed the platform with the goal of providing affordances to make it easy to&nbsp;move from passive learning to active, and then to constructive.&nbsp;W</span>e'll explore a bit about these first three of the four modes, and in particular, how to use technology to move towards constructive learning.&nbsp;</span>Here's </span><a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf" target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.6;">a paper</a><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> explaining these concepts&nbsp;in more detail if you are interested. The paper strongly suggests that moving from passive to active, and again from active to constructive shows large learning gains (although there are researchers who credibly disagree with the latter assertion).&nbsp;</span>The longer-term goal is to get to interactive, but we're not there yet.&nbsp;</p>
