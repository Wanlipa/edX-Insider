<p>There's a neat framework for thinking about how students learn
called ICAP. The gist of ICAP is that there are four ways of
delivering information: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passive</strong>: For example, listening to a lecture. Watching a video. Quietly reading a book.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Manipulating concepts. For example, underlining text in a book, or working through a problem applying information just learned. </li>
<li><strong>Constructive</strong>: Figuring things out. Creating new information. For example, deriving a key theorem, or writing a paper. </li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>: Learning through peer interactions. </li>
</ul>

<p>The terms used here mean very different things to different
people. In particular, <strong>constructive learning</strong> has very
different meanings in different research communities. For example,
many members in educational philosophy use it interchangeably
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)"
target="[object Object]">constructivist learning</a>, which is at best
weakly related to the definition from ICAP (which comes from a
cognitive science community). Likewise, active learning often embodies
the full spectrum. Just to have a common language, throughout this
unit, we'll use the language of ICAP (and use constructivist when
refering to the use from educational psychology). </p>

<p> Piotr originally designed the platform with the goal of providing
affordances to make it easy to move from passive learning to active,
and then to constructive (although not yet to interactive). Most
courses on edX have gone as far as the first step, to active, with
simple embedded &quot;finger exercises&quot;. We'll explore a bit
about these first three of the four modes, and in particular, how to
use technology to move towards constructive
learning. Here's <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf"
target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.6;">a paper</a> explaining these
concepts in more detail if you are interested. The paper strongly
suggests that moving from passive to active, and again from active to
constructive shows large learning gains (although there are
researchers who credibly disagree with the latter assertion). A
longer-term goal of the platform is to also enable interactive (which
is only sometime better than constructive), but we're not there
yet. </p>
