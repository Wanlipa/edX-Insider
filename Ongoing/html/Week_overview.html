<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;"><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;">This is a unit on how we designed the edX platform to help bring constructive learning -- a concept in cognitive science developed by Miki Chi -- to education. There are two goals behind this. First of all, it is a helpful to understand this aspect of the platform. Second of all, as a deep dive, it is a good examplar of how technology can act as an enabler for key concepts from learning science. This is one of the many techniques applied within the edX platform. </p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand constructive learning, as&nbsp;designed into the edX platform.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Understand at least one additional topic in educational research.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sketch up how you would present a topic as a constructive learning sequence.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Think about how technology can embody other principles from learning sciences.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;"><strong>Integrated Learning Sequences</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;">A&nbsp;goal of the design of the edX platform was to start using the technology in more <em>active</em> and&nbsp;<em>constructive</em> ways. While this term is oft-debated in education circles, there is a clear delineation between people watching videos passively and being actively engaged in learning. If we make a simple comparison between, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A student watches a long video.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watches a video with questions asked every 15 minutes to check understanding.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watch a sequence of 1-4 minute videos interleaved with problems, simulations, and discussions where the student is actively engaged in constructing their understanding of the material.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">With each step, we are moving towards a place where the student is more engaged&nbsp;in the learning process, and learns more&nbsp;enjoyably and effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>ICAP:</strong></p>
<p>The theory underlying this approach is from <a title="Michelene Chi" href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AlW99VQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;cstart=20" target="_self">Michelene Chi</a>. Her work in physics education stretches back to the 1980s and the particular work we are discussing is the ICAP framework. It presents<a title="ICAP " href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf" target="_blank"> a Passive/Active/Constructive/Interactive categorization</a> that might be useful for us&nbsp;as a framework for discussing the design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>

This module is a learning process. The first time most courses are
run, they tend to be horrific, due to lack
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Shulman#Pedagogical_content_knowledge_.28PCK.29">pedagogical
content knowledge</a> -- an understanding of what aspects of the
course are hard, what aspects are easy, and similar. There is
either <a href="http://theknowledgetransfercompany.typepad.com/introduction/2011/07/the-expert-blind-spot.html">an
expert blindspot</a>, or overcompensation for the possibility of
one. If we can improve a course like this, it could act as a means to
solve any of several problems facing the organization: </p>

<ul>
<li> Eating our own dogfood. </li>
<li> Providing training resources for edX instructors. </li>
<li> Better on-boarding for new edX employees around pedagogy, mission, technology, etc. </li>
<li> Internally disseminating what we know about learning. </li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;">As a
result, your feedback is essential. It's sufficiently essential that
generating feedback on this course is a deliverable this
week. Generating this feedback will help you think about pedagogy, and
apply what you're learning. As you go through this module, be careful
to pay attention not just to the <i>content</i> of the module, but
also to the pedagogical and technological design. We will quiz you
about this later. If you'd like to contribute more substantially,
please do make <a href="https://github.com/pmitros/edX-Insider">pull
request against the course on github</a>. </p>
