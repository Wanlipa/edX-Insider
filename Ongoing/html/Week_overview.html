<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;">This is a unit on how we designed the edX platform to help bring constructive learning -- a concept in cognitive science developed by Miki Chi -- to education. There are two goals behind this. First of all, it is a helpful to understand this aspect of the platform. Second of all, as a deep dive, it is a good examplar of how technology can act as an enabler for key concepts from learning science. This is one of the many techniques applied within the edX platform. </p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand constructive learning, as&nbsp;designed into the edX platform.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Understand at least one additional topic in educational research.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sketch up how you would present a topic as a constructive learning sequence.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Think about how technology can embody other principles from learning sciences.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.600000381469727px;">A&nbsp;goal of the design of the edX platform was to start using the technology in more <em>active</em> and&nbsp;<em>constructive</em> ways. While this term is oft-debated in education circles, there is a clear delineation between people watching videos passively and being actively engaged in learning. If we make a simple comparison between, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A student watches a long video.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watches a video with questions asked every 15 minutes to check understanding.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watch a sequence of 1-4 minute videos interleaved with problems, simulations, and discussions where the student is actively engaged in constructing their understanding of the material.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">With each step, we are moving towards a place where the student is more engaged&nbsp;in the learning process, and learns more&nbsp;enjoyably and effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>ICAP:</strong></p>
<p>The theory underlying this approach is from <a title="Michelene Chi" href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AlW99VQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;cstart=20" target="_self">Michelene Chi</a>. Her work in physics education stretches back to the 1980s and the particular work we are discussing is the ICAP framework. It presents<a title="ICAP " href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf" target="_blank"> a Passive/Active/Constructive/Interactive categorization</a> that might be useful for us&nbsp;as a framework for discussing the design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
