<h2>Applications to STEM</h2>

<p>A really neat technique for going to constructive learning in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education are interactive demonstrations.</p>
<p>A great example will be shown in the next element of this sequence, based on question designed by Marcello Pagano, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health, working with myself. Marcello asked his students how they might evaluate hospitals for quality, and suggested mortality as a possible metric &mdash; out of a thousand people entering the hospital, how many people die? Before going on -- what do you think? Is that a good metric? What do you think happens?</p>
