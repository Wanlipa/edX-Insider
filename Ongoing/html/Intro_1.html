<p>We'll start out with an example of a Socratic style learning sequence to do a math proof. A sequence like this required about 25 dollars of equipment to record, beyond a basic cell phone, and a few hours time. It moves information transfer from passive up to active or constructive (with those terms as defined in the ICAP framework). Compare this to watching a video of a derivation. </p>

<p> Walk through this example (doing the problems and watching the videos -- this won't take much time -- notice how short they are). This is actually the basic model we envisioned when designing the MITx (now Open edX) platform.</p>
