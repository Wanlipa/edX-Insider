<p>To give you a better idea of how constructive learning works, we'll start out with an example of a tutorial-style learning sequence which moves information transfer from passive up to active or constructive on the ICAP spectrum. Walk through this example (doing the problems and watching the videos -- this won't take much time -- notice how short they are). This will help you build an intuition for how the platform was initially designed to be used (back when we were a research project at MIT). We'll come back to the theory of why in a moment.</p>

<p> As you work through this sequence, think about both the pedagogical and technological elements used, which ones work well, which work poorly, and why.</p>
