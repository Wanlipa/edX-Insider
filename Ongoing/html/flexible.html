<p>Most theories of learning involve an integration of multiple stages and types of learning. Constructive dialogue-style learning sequences are more applicable to some of those than to others. Take a look at a Kolb cycle, or any similar theory, and you will see that applied projects, theory, project-based learning, deliberate practice, and most other techniques have their place. Learning is an integrated process with many components:</p>

<p>You might, for example, have students apply knowledge to build intuition in a surface fashion (as in the HSPH example). Once students have intuition, you might introduce theory to tie it together. At that point, you could use deliberate practice to help build mastery. This might lead into a project, to allow students to apply knowledge with minimal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding">scaffolding</a>. The set of stages is discipline-specific, and the pedagogical best-practices is specific to both the discipline and the stage. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the edX platform wasn't designed to force people into constructive learning or any other particular pedagogy, but to provide a platform with frameworks like XBlocks and the upcoming APIs around the Insights analytics modules and flexible content stores to allow people to construct and use a range of pedagogies, applying the most appropriate pedagogy to the task.</p>
