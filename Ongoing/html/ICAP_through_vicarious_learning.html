<p>This section is completely optional. However,&nbsp;there is a substantial body of literature that suggests that watching videos of expert-novice interactions is more effective than watching experts. This work was pioneered and originally popularized by Derek Muller (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcX3IW00nuk">TED Video overview</a>). It was rigorously studied and further developed by Miki Chi (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21635338">Miki's paper</a>), who found that watching videos of expert-novice interactions together in small groups, with the ability to pause, discuss, and rewind, was almost as effective as 1:1 tutoring. Results on student enjoyment have been mixed; in some cases, students find such videos confusing (but learn more!), and in some cases, they like the additional personality of these videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by this, in this video, Piotr walks David, as well as a few students, through how he designed the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">the MITx/edX platform around&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">constructive learning, and what he means by the term in this context</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
