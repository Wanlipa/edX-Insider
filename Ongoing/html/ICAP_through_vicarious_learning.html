<p>This section is completely optional. In the Kolb cycle you saw
previously, there was a step of tying application together with
theory. This sequence gives more of the theoretical basis behind
constructive learning, as embodied in the edX platform. It's
relatively rough, but it also experiments with several presentation
styles. </p>

<p> There is a substantial body of literature that suggests that
watching videos of expert-novice interactions is more effective than
watching experts. This work was pioneered and originally popularized
by Derek Muller
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcX3IW00nuk">TED Video
overview</a>). It was rigorously studied and further developed by Miki
Chi (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21635338">Miki's
paper</a>), who found that watching videos of expert-novice
interactions together in small groups, with the ability to pause,
discuss, and rewind, was almost as effective as 1:1 tutoring. Results
on student enjoyment have been mixed; in some cases, students find
such videos confusing (but learn more!), and in some cases, they like
the additional personality of these videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inspired by this, in the following video, Piotr walks David Cormier
(the early pioneer who first coined the term MOOC), as well as a few
students, through how he designed the the MITx/edX platform
around constructive learning, and what he means by the term in this
context. </p>
