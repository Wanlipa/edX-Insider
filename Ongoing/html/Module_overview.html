<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

<p>This course is designed to demo a few ways the edX platform was designed to make learning more engaging, more interactive, amd more pedagogically effective. </p>

<p> If you find this unit helpful, let me know, and I'll create future units on other key pedagogical principles applied to the design of the edX platform, such as mastery learning, rapid feedback, and gamification. If you don't like it, or have feedback, let me know as well (<a href="mailto:pmitros@edx.org">pmitros@edx.org</a>). This is a prototype unit, and I would like to continue to improve it for future instructors. </p>

<p><strong>First time on edX?</strong></p>
