<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

<p>This unit describes how we designed the edX platform to help bring constructive learning to education. There are a couple of motivations behind the creation of this course. First of all, it's a way to demonstrate to new course authors one of the ways the platform can be used to convey information in a way dramatically more effective than in a traditional classroom setting. Second, it does, in the process, teach one of the key pedagogical principles behind the platform. Finally, as a deep dive, the design of constructive learning in the edX platform is a good example of how technology can use key concepts from the learning sciences. </p>

<p> If you find this unit helpful, we may create future units on other key pedagogical principles applied to the design of the edX platform, such as mastery learning, rapid feedback, and gamification.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand constructive learning as designed into the edX platform.</li>
<li>Think about how technology can work with other principles from the learning sciences.</li>
<p>Understand how to create an active and constructive learning experience that actively engages students in learning. This is an alternative to simply having them watch videos, which is a much more passive mode of learning.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, as we said, learning is an <i>active</i> process. You will learn much more from this course if you not only pay attention to the <i>content</i> of this course module but also to the <i>instructional design</i>. In next weeks meeting, we will ask you to <i>construct</i> feedback about this course. Generating this feedback will help you think about pedagogy and apply what you're learning. As you go through this module be careful to pay attention not just to the content of the module but also to the pedagogical and technological design. If you'd like to contribute more substantially, please make a <a href="https://github.com/pmitros/edX-Insider">pull request against the course on github</a>. </p>
