<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

<p>This unit describes how I designed the edX platform to help bring constructive learning to education. There are a couple of motivations behind the creation of this course:
<ul>
<li> It's a way to demonstrate one of the ways the platform can be used to convey information in a way more effective than in a traditional classroom setting.</li> 
<li> It will help you understand one particular and especially useful principle -- constructive learning -- and apply it to your own courses</li>
<li> As a deep dive into how to use edX to bring one theory from learning science into classrooms, it acts as an example as you try to incorporate other aspects. </li>
</ul>

<p> If you find this unit helpful, let me know, and I'll create future units on other key pedagogical principles applied to the design of the edX platform, such as mastery learning, rapid feedback, and gamification. If you don't like it, or have feedback, let me know as well (<a href="mailto:pmitros@edx.org">pmitros@edx.org</a>). This is a prototype unit, and I would like to continue to improve it for future instructors. </p>
