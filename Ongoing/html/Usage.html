<p>This learning sequence is one example of the <em>many</em> ways to do tutorial-style learning sequences in edX. Take a moment to think about some of the other elements of this sequence: </p>
<ul>
<li> Did you notice all the video content had a text alternative? </li>
<li> Did you notice although the problems were integrated with the videos, they were usable stand-alone? </li>
<li> Navigational elements made it easy for students to skip or repeat content. Why was this important in the way videos were designed? </li>
<li> The videos in this sequence were filmed with a cell phone on a $20 Gorillapod. They were then edited and transcoded at low quality. Audio was over a corded headset ($5, but positioned close to the mouth to minimize noisy and room acoustics). How did this impact your experience? </li>
</ul>
