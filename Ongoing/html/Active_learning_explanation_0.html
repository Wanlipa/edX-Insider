<p>I thought this one wasn't as good. You probably checked all of the boxes. If so, it's analogous to underlining text. It's more active than just reading or listening, but not much more active. Still, it's sometimes hard to do fully constructive, and going as active or as constructive as time allows still helps. In studies, Kaplan found students learned a little bit more even if the only way in which the interaction was active was by having to hit a "next" button in a sequence.&nbsp;</p>
