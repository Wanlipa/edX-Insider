<h2>Pedagogical Theory Behind the Course</h2>

<p>The terminology used in this sequence comes from <a title="Michelene Chi" href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AlW99VQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;cstart=20" target="_self">Michelene Chi</a>. She defined a framework called <a title="ICAP " href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf" target="_blank"> categorizes four different ways of learning: Passive, Active, Constructive, Interactive.</a> This categorization is a useful framework for discussing the design of courses for the edX platform:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passive</strong>: Simply taking in information. For example, listening to a lecture. Watching a video. Quietly reading a book. In edX: <i>A student watches a long video.</i></li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Manipulating concepts. For example, underlining text in a book, or working through a problem applying information just learned. In edX: <i>A student watches a video with questions asked every few minutes to check understanding.</i></li>
<li><strong>Constructive</strong>: Figuring things out. Creating new information. For example, deriving a key theorem, writing a paper, or writing a critique of this course. In edX: <i>A student watches a sequence of 1-4 minute videos interspersed with problems, simulations, and discussions where the student is actively engaged in constructing their understanding of the material.</i></li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>: Learning through peer interactions. For example, working on a group project in an engineering course, or debating with peers in a course on philosophy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Miki's group performed a meta-analysis of many education papers, and found that students learned better stepping up from passive to active, and again from active to constructive. The edX platform was designed to make it easier to move from passive learning to active learning and then to constructive learning (although not yet to interactive). Most courses on edX have gone as far as the first step &mdash; active learning, using simple embedded &quot;finger exercises&quot;. This learning sequence is a demonstration of how to build constructive learning on the edX platform, with a goal of moving more courses in that direction.</p> 

<p>This is one of the many evidence-based approaches embodied in the edX platform; if you like this unit, let us know, and we'll create a few more about authentic assessment, mastery learning, remediation of misconceptions, rapid feedback, and others. </p>

<p> <b>A note on terminology</b>: Education research is grouped into silos which use <i>very</i> different bits of terminology. For example, most educational philosophers will use the word &quot;constructive&quot; interchangeably with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)">constructivist</a>. Interactive can mean the same thing as active in some communities. Just to have a common language, throughout this unit we'll use the language of ICAP. Be careful using this terminology elsewhere, at least without defining the terms</p>
