<section><article><h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This module was created to give a few demos of how the edX platform may be used to create effective learning sequences for the authors of the blended track at Learning@Scale. </p>

<p>This is a prototype. Please pardon the rough edges (but as you find them, let me know about them, or otherwise what you think at <a href="mailto:pmitros@edx.org">pmitros@edx.org</a>)</p>

<p> This course is available under an open license, and the OLX is available on <a href="https://github.com/pmitros/edX-Insider/tree/pmitros/learning-at-scale">github</a>. This version is in the pmitros/learning-at-scale branch. </p>
