 1. Mindset interventions

There is a substantial body of work that suggests students learn much
more effectively with an appropriate mindset. Perhaps the best known
of these results is the work on the growth mindset by Carol
Dweck. Dweck has strong evidence that if students believe that
intelligence is fixed, they will learn less than if they believe
intelligence is malleable. She has a set of interventions -- ranging
from explanations of the growth mindset to more subtle techniques such
as complementing students for effort rather than for success -- which
help lead to a growth mindset.

 2. Forgetting curves

One of the least surprising results in learning science is that we
retain knowledge much more effectively if we use it or repeat it. A
study by David Pritchard at MIT compared student exam results in
freshman physics between students who continued to use physics in
future coursework, and ones who did not. The difference was
tremendous.

This is closely related to the concept of spaced repetition, but with
different timescales. Spaced repetition (which another group is
looking at) is useful for e.g. schedules for looking over factoidss on
flash cards. Here, we're concerned about complex concepts, and
practice over semesters and years.

 3. Spaced repetition

Especially in fields like language learning, we can learn things much
more quickly with a technique called spaced repetition. In spaced
repetition, a fact is repeated at the time you're about to forget
it. For example, there might be a schedule where something is
explained, repeated 5 seconds later, 15 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes,
30 minutes, after 1 day, after 2 days, after one week, and after one
month. Spaced repetition can lead to dramatically fast learning of simple,
factual knowledge.

 4. Mastery learning

In materials taught with mastery learning, you don't move on to future
materials until you've mastered a concept, so you do not try to learn
information without prerequisite knowledge. A famous result by Bloom
showed that a typical tutored students will outperform 95% of students
in a traditional classroom. About half of this benefit comes from
mastery learning. If a student phases out for a moment in lecture,
they might miss a critical concept, and misunderstand the rest of the
lecture. In contrast, a tutor stopping on concepts until the student
masters them.

Aside from learning science, support for many of the techniques used
to typically implement mastery learning are found in a number of
disciplines:

* Self-regulated learning. Many forms of one include the other. 
* Gamification. In mastery learning, students are generally rewarded
  for progress, rather than seriously punished for errors (e.g. you
  try again, rather than permanently losing a letter grade). This
  matches what we know about motivation.
* Mindset and attitude. Traditional classroom grading severely
  punishes intellectual risktaking, since penalties for errors are
  severe and permanent.
* Rapid feedback and formative assessment. Mastery learning generally
  requires providing students or instructors with means to immediately
  monitor student learning.

 6. Targetting misconceptions

In many disciplines, especially ones like physics, most of learning is
unlearning. Students come in with significant misconceptions, and much
of the process consists of identifying and breaking down those
misconceptions. 

 7. Teaching 21st Century Skills

While there is a perception that employers want directly applicable
skills, the reality is that most employers increasingly want 21st
century skills
(http://chronicle.com/article/Giving-Employers-What-They/139877). We've
selected five skills
(http://www.imls.gov/about/21st_century_skills_list.aspx) to focus on:

* Critical thinking, creativity, innovation, and problem solving
* Financial, economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy
* Flexibility, adaptation, initiative, and self-direction
* Social, collaborative, and cross-cultural skils
* Leadership and responsibility

Come up with a way in which technology can be used to more effectively
teach one or more of these skills. 

 8. Assessing 21st Century Skills

While there is a perception that employers want directly applicable
skills, the reality is that most employers increasingly want 21st
century skills
(http://chronicle.com/article/Giving-Employers-What-They/139877). We've

* Financial, economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy
* Flexibility, adaptation, initiative, and self-direction
* Social, collaborative, and cross-cultural skils
* Leadership and responsibility

Come up with a way in which technology can be used to more effectively
assess and measure students on these skills.

19. Identity and emotional connection

Several studies found that students what aspects of a teacher's
personality lead to improved student outcomes. Suprisingly,
personality didn't matter much -- what mattered was whether the
students had an emotional connection with the teacher, and whether the
teacher cared about the students. This is part of a broader set of
research which shows that students do best when they engage and
identify with their learning environment. Social connections are
identified as one good way to build that engagement and identity.

20. Expert/novice patterns

Roles: 
* Facilitator. Goal: Make sure group comes to concensus
* Worker: Do the work. 
* Challenger: Challenge ideas. Bring in creativity.
