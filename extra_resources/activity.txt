In-class activity

Step 1: 

If you have not yet done so, read the topic in pedagogy 

Roles: 

Facilitator: Your job is to keep the discussion moving. Ask
questions. Acknowledge what others have said. Make sure everyone gets
a chance to speak. Keep the group on-track, and make sure things get
done on time. Make sure that the group converges on a single, helpful
plan. A good model for a discussion is to start narrow (core pedagogy
idea), broaden out (open-ended discussion about approaches), and then
converge (move into a deep dive of one approach).

Explorer: Your job is to make sure whatever comes out at the end is
awesome and innovative. Encourage imagination. Contribute new and
alternative perspectives and ideas. Seek to uncover new potential in
situations and people (fellow team members but also clients) and
explore new areas of inquiry. Raise constructive counter-arguments,
and alternative solutions. Push the group to explore all possibilities

Recorder: Keep notes. As group members describe things, create
mock-ups and prototypes.
